## Why this exists

Banks give you an EMI amount and a tenure, but they don't make it easy to answer questions like:

- If I put in 2 lakhs extra this year, how many months do I shave off?
- How much total interest am I saving with my part payments?
- My bank's EMI is slightly different from the formula — can I use the exact number?

This tool lets you model your actual loan, plug in your bank's EMI, add part payments, and instantly see the impact on your tenure and total interest — with a full amortization schedule that matches your bank's statement.

## What you can do

**Set up your loan** — enter principal, rate, tenure, and start date. Use the calculated EMI or enter your bank's exact EMI amount.

**Add part payments** — record any lump-sum payments you've made or plan to make. The amortization schedule updates instantly to show the reduced balance and shorter tenure.

**See the savings** — interactive charts show your balance trajectory, interest vs principal breakdown, and a side-by-side comparison of your loan with and without part payments. Summary cards show months saved, interest saved, and your new end date.

**Track multiple loans** — manage home loan, car loan, personal loan — each as a separate project with its own schedule and analysis.

**Full amortization table** — month-by-month breakdown showing opening balance, interest, principal, part payments, and closing balance. Matches bank statements when using the EMI override.

**Export and import** — download your projects as JSON to back up or transfer between devices. Everything runs in the browser with no account needed.
